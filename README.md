## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure you have one of the following installed on your system:
-   Conda
-   Python 3.11+ and Pip
-   Docker

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Basic-CLI-ChatBot.git`, then navigate into the new directory with `cd Basic-CLI-ChatBot`.

From there, choose your preferred installation method below.

<details>
<summary><strong>üîµ Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)</strong></summary>

1.  **Create the Environment**: Execute the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` to build the environment from the specification file.
2.  **Activate the Environment**: Once created, activate it with `conda activate cli-chatbot`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üü° Option 2: Using Pip and a Virtual Environment</strong></summary>

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment**: It is best practice to create a virtual environment. You can do this with `python3 -m venv venv`.
2.  **Activate the Environment**:
    -   On macOS/Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
    -   On Windows, run `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.
3.  **Install Packages**: Install all required dependencies by running `pip install "openai" "anthropic" "google-generativeai" "groq" "rich" "typer[all]" "prompt-toolkit" "python-dotenv" "nest-asyncio"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö™ Option 3: Using Docker</strong></summary>

1.  **Build the Image**: From the project's root directory, build the Docker image by running the command `docker build -t cli-chatbot .`.
2.  You can run the container after completing the configuration step below.

</details>

### üîë Configuration

The chatbot needs API keys to communicate with the AI providers.

1.  Create your personal configuration file by making a copy of the example: `cp .env.example .env`.
2.  Open the newly created `.env` file in a text editor and add your API keys for the services you wish to use. You only need to fill in the ones you have access to.

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
    GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
    ```

> The application will also automatically detect keys set as environment variables in your system, which will take precedence over the `.env` file.

---

## üí¨ Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured your API keys, you can start the chatbot.

-   If you used **Conda or Pip**, run the application with `python chatbot.py chat`.
-   If you are using **Docker**, launch the interactive container with `docker run --env-file .env -it cli-chatbot`.

Upon starting, you will be prompted to select a provider and a model. After that, you're ready to chat!

### In-Chat Commands

| Command                 | Action                                       |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `clear`                 | Clears the current conversation history.     |
| `quit`, `exit`, or `q`  | Exits the chatbot application.               |
| `Ctrl+C`                | Interrupts a streaming response or exits.    |
